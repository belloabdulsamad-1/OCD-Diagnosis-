# Brief

After some days of intense data transformation and analysis in SQL, Iâ€™ve created a dynamic report
that uncovers actionable insights into patient performance metrics for OCD diagnosis.

This project challenged me to leverage a powerful toolkit: 

SQL: for database querying and analysis
Microsoft Power BI: for dynamic visualizations and dashboards 
MS Word & PowerPoint: for structured documentation and stakeholder-ready presentations
